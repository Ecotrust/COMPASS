On October 13, 1995, the Department of Environmental Protection implemented Section 161.055, of the Florida Statutes, initiating concurrent processing of applications for coastal construction permits, environmental resource permits and sovereign submerged lands authorizations. These permits and authorizations, which were previously issued separately, and by different state agencies, have now been consolidated into a \"joint coastal permit\" or JCP. The consolidation of these reviews and the assignment of responsibility into a single program has eliminated the potential for conflict between permitting agencies and helped ensure that reviews are conducted in a timely manner. A copy of each permit application is forwarded to the United States Army Corps of Engineers for separate processing of the federal dredge and fill permit, if necessary. Activities that require a JCP include beach restoration or nourishment; construction of erosion control structures such as groins and breakwaters; public fishing piers; maintenance of inlets and inlet-related structures; and dredging of navigation channels that include disposal of dredged material onto the beach or in the nearshore area.\r\n",

The ESI data include information for three main components: shoreline habitats, sensitive biological resources, and human-use resources. Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) is more properly known as \"Sensitivity of Coastal Habitats and Wildlife to Spilled Oil\" Atlases.  The term \"ESI\" is often used in reference to the whole dataset, but the term \"ESI\" is really a reference to the classification system of shoreline types known as Environmental Sensitivity Index, that classifies a shoreline on a scale from 1 to 10 based upon overall sensitivity to spilled oil.\r\n",

Points were plotted from the code and lines were drawn between them to illustrate the gap. The code reads as follows: (l) Applications for telecommunication lines received after October 29, 2003 that originate from or extend to locations outside of the state\u2019s territorial limits through the territorial sea including the area between mean high and mean low water lines and any associated conduits shall be subject to the following:1. Installations shall be approved only where the applicant provides satisfactory evidence of a need by providing documentation in the form of: a. A copy of their Federal Communications Commission cable landing license; and either b. A contract to install telecommunication lines and associated conduits to an upland distribution network and stating the projected date of installation; or c. A letter of commitment from a company in the business of installing or using telecommunication lines for a line that will be installed and connected to an upland distribution network, functional for transmitting data, and on-line within a specified time frame once a conduit is made available.2. Installations at individual landing sites are limited to no more than six telecommunication lines and conduits except where the applicant can affirmatively demonstrate that the landing site will support a larger number of such lines and that the routing to the State\u2019s territorial limits within the territorial sea will cause no more than minimal individual and cumulative impacts. However, installations using subconduits within a conduit shall be allowed up to six subconduits and one additional conduit. In no case shall more than two conduits with subconduits be authorized until such time as the capacity of one conduit is fully utilized for telecommunication line installation.3. Installations shall be prohibited on or under submerged lands within Biscayne Bay Aquatic Preserve, Biscayne Bay National Park, and Monroe County. 4. Conduits for telecommunication lines shall be directionally drilled under nearshore benthic resources, including the first reef and any other more inshore reefs off Southeast Florida, to the maximum extent practicable and shall punch out in a location that avoids or minimizes impacts to benthic resources such as seagrasses and live bottom communities including corals and sponges. 5. While locating in these areas is not required for approval, special consideration areas are designated for telecommunication lines and associated conduits located within the reef-gaps generally described as follows, based on World Geodetic System 84. a.

AHED contains all structures operated by SFWMD and also some that belong to city, county, and 298 districts. The non district features are added in areas that are operationally important for the district. The Structure feature class was populated using the Enterprise Structure SDE Layer (IMFDC_STRUCTURE_SITE) and additional locations provided by the District within the Stormwater Treatment Areas. Once Structures were added to AHED, the locations were verified using the 1:12000 DOQQs or higher resolution county imagery.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) have embarked upon a collaborative effort to produce an online tool to allow for the open dissemination of Acropora-related datasets. An ArcGIS geodatabase has been built with the purpose of effective and accurate depiction of benthic data related to Acropora palmataand A. cervicornis. The geodatabase has been populated with significant multi-agency data from federal, state, university and non-government organizations. These agencies include NOAA, National Park Service, FWC, University of Miami, Univeristy of North Carolina - Wilmington, National Coral Reef Institute and The Nature Conservancy. All datasets include Acropora presence/absence and latitudinal /longitudinal coordinates at the minimum.

Stony coral data were collected from multiple habitat types across the south Florida shelf from St. Lucie Inlet to Biscayne Bay for years 2005 through 2014. The data were collected during synoptic broad-scale surveys of coral reef and hard-bottom habitats that were stratified into sub-regions or along-shelf positions (e.g., Biscayne, SEFCRI and various habitat types (e.g., patch reefs, low relief hard-bottom, high-relief spur and groove, etc.). A 200m x 200m polygon grid was used to overlay onto existing bathymetry and benthic habitat maps of the study area, and a two-stage stratified random design was used to select sites for sampling from various strata combinations of cross-shelf habitat type, along-shelf position (i.e. region), and management zone (http://frrp.org/).

        "description": "This dataset includes indices for intensity of bleaching, disease prevalence, and reef resilience for the SEFCRI region as performed in VanWoesik and Burman 2012. Data were collected by a variety of institutions under the coordination of the Nature Conservancy\u2019s Florida Reef Resilience Program. Stony coral data were collected from multiple habitat types across the south Florida shelf from St. Lucie Inlet to Biscayne Bay for years 2005 through 2014. The data were collected during synoptic broad-scale surveys of coral reef and hard-bottom habitats that were stratified into sub-regions or along-shelf positions (e.g., Biscayne, SEFCRI and various habitat types (e.g., patch reefs, low relief hard-bottom, high-relief spur and groove, etc.). A 200m x 200m polygon grid was used to overlay onto existing bathymetry and benthic habitat maps of the study area, and a two-stage stratified random design was used to select sites for sampling from various strata combinations of cross-shelf habitat type, along-shelf position (i.e. region), and management zone (http://frrp.org/). Index classes were based on 2 standard deviations for Coral Density (1.91), Standardized Bleaching index (1.6), and Standardized Disease Index (0.847). Sites where values were greater than 2 SDs received a 1, all others a 0. The Reef Resilience Index was the result of Coral density class, minus the SBI class, minus the SDI class. Sites with a value of 2 are valued the highest as they have relatively high coral cover and low bleaching and disease prevalence.

These include outfalls (FDEP), popular dive sites (created by FWRI, derived from http://www.divespots.com/scuba-diving-spots/florida/florida-keys/), dredge disposal sites (FWRI - MRGIS), ship lanes (FWRI - MRGIS), vessel corridors (FWRI - MRGIS), marinas (FWRI - MRGIS), anchorages (FWRI - MRGIS), and reef injuries (FWRI - MRGIS). A 1 kilometer grid was created using XTools Pro and the resulting grid was clipped to the study area boundary. One kilometer buffers were created for all stress layers, and a \"Stress_Ind\" field was added. The \"Stress_Ind\" field was calculated as \"1\" for all stressors. For the reef injuries layer, groundings were isolated and classified as a \"1,\" whereas the remaining injuries were classified as \"0.5\" to represent the less severe nature of the remaining injuries (i.e. anchorings). All stress layers were merged and the spatial join tool (using a sum merge rule) was used to append the total number of intersections of stressors (found in the \"Stress_Ind\" field) with the grid. The resulting polygonal grid was converted to a raster and a 1km cell output was ensured.\r\n",

Vessel information (location, type, length, and activity) and passenger information (activity) were collected for 3579 vessels that were observed off of Miami-Dade and Broward counties during periods of low, medium, and high use between 4/29/2008 and 11/19/2009 (CRUPS project) and between 7/4/2012 and 7/30/2014 (Mooring Buoy Project, or MBP).

In addition, the researchers sought to develop methods that would form the basis for a standardized, repeatable approach to monitoring and characterizing the coral reef usage patterns by recreational and commercial vessels. The second study sought to determine if anchoring patterns and coral reef damage had changed as a result of installation of mooring buoys in Miami-Dade County.

        "description": "The Our Florida Reefs survey collected data on how and where southeast Florida\u2019s coral reefs are being visited by residents and guests. All survey participants\u2019 data have been combined to create maps that show a summary of where people are visiting the reefs, what activities they are participating in, and how often those areas are visited. The survey used a non-probability based \u201cOpt-In\u201d sample methodology that engaged ocean and coastal recreation stakeholders by deploying targeted outreach strategies to solicit participation in an opt-in method of data collection. Respondents were asked to provide information and map their coastal and ocean recreation activities from the last 12 months. Collecting data using an internet \u201copt-in\u201d mode provides many advantages. It gathers data from populations that are not well defined and in which a robust probability based sample cannot be developed or feasibly collected. It provides a participatory approach and engages and builds stakeholder investment. It also provides the ability to collect data and obtain larger sample sizes from specific user groups (e.g. SCUBA divers, kayakers, etc.) that are difficult to adequately capture in general population surveys. Lastly, it increases the likelihood that stakeholders will trust the survey results and therefore accept their use in policy-making processes. Based on this opt-in method, the data could not be extrapolated to the general population, however it provides spatial data on many activities, as well as activity participation rates, and average expenditure profiles. Maps depicting spatial patterns of use (extent and intensity of use) for specific coastal recreational activities were created. These maps are aggregated into activity groupings requested by the Community Working Group members to help facilitate their use in planning and policy contexts. The final activity groupings are boating, recreational fishing, SCUBA diving, spearfishing, extractive diving, and water sports. An overlap layer has also been created to show locations where both fishers and divers frequent and the estimated intensity of this overlap.\r\n",

        "description": "The Our Florida Reefs survey collected data on how and where southeast Florida\u2019s coral reefs are being visited by residents and guests. All survey participants\u2019 data have been combined to create maps that show a summary of where people are visiting the reefs, what activities they are participating in, and how often those areas are visited. The survey used a non-probability based \u201cOpt-In\u201d sample methodology that engaged ocean and coastal recreation stakeholders by deploying targeted outreach strategies to solicit participation in an opt-in method of data collection. Respondents were asked to provide information and map their coastal and ocean recreation activities from the last 12 months. Collecting data using an internet \u201copt-in\u201d mode provides many advantages. It gathers data from populations that are not well defined and in which a robust probability based sample cannot be developed or feasibly collected. It provides a participatory approach and engages and builds stakeholder investment. It also provides the ability to collect data and obtain larger sample sizes from specific user groups (e.g. SCUBA divers, kayakers, etc.) that are difficult to adequately capture in general population surveys. Lastly, it increases the likelihood that stakeholders will trust the survey results and therefore accept their use in policy-making processes. Based on this opt-in method, the data could not be extrapolated to the general population, however it provides spatial data on many activities, as well as activity participation rates, and average expenditure profiles. Maps depicting spatial patterns of use (extent and intensity of use) for specific coastal recreational activities were created. These maps are aggregated into activity groupings requested by the Community Working Group members to help facilitate their use in planning and policy contexts. The final activity groupings are boating, recreational fishing, SCUBA diving, spearfishing, extractive diving, and water sports. An overlap layer has also been created to show locations where both fishers and divers frequent and the estimated intensity of this overlap.\r\n",

An SSU can be a single visual plot or an combination of multiple plots. Reef fishes are an important biologic, ecologic, and economic resource of the marine ecosystem which must be managed for sustainability. However, until recently there was no long-term monitoring program in place to assess the state of the fish resources of the northern FRT (northern Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, and Martin counties). An assessment/monitoring plan for the northern Florida reef tract was designed through a joint cooperative effort by scientists at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, NOAA-Southeast Fisheries Science Center and Nova Southeastern University Oceanographic Center. This effort was originally funded for three years (2012, 2013, and 2014). The majority of the field work was accomplished through funding granted to NSUOC. However, a significant amount of data was also collected by multiple partner agencies that were able to dedicate their time and resources to the cause. In 2012 funding for the first year of data collection was awarded by FDEP to NSUOC on July 1st, 2012. Funding for a second year of sampling was awarded by NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) to NSUOC through the National Coral Reef Institute (NCRI) Cooperative Agreement.

It is already clear there are significant differences in the current geographic distribution of the regional and local reef fishes. There are interacting strata and latitudinal differences in total abundance, species, sizes, and assemblage structure.

        "description": "These data show the observed distribution of lion fish in south Florida from 2010-2013 only. They were compiled by Pam Schofield from USGS and are continually updated and corrected. Please visit (http://nas2.er.usgs.gov/viewer/omap.aspx?SpeciesID=963) to view the real-time map. Lionfish are an invasive species in the United States. They inhabit natural (e.g., reef) and artifical structure (e.g., wrecks) at depths from just a few inches of water to over 300 m. In the invaded range, lionfishes have been found in a variety of habitats, including reefs, wrecks, bridge pilings, seagrass and natural hardbottom. In the U.S., lionfishes have rapidly increased in abundance. The data points that are displayed do not constitute the total dataset. Not all specimens/reports are included in the database; after a species is well-established in an area data are no longer entered. The data shown on the map accurately depict the extent of the areal coverage of lionfish, but do not include all points for all times. Data is constantly added and corrected, so the dataset changes on a daily basis. The USGS is the national repository for non-native aquatic species, and so the database is compiled of several datasets from partnering agencies and cooperators as well as the general public. It is pieced together from many different sources. Not all sites are sampled in all years, they are opportunistic reports. This data set should not be assumed to be complete. This data is not comprehensive of all introductions in all localities. Hence, these data should not be the sole source for analysis. The goal is to show distribution; not to document abundance. Thus, the dataset is not amenable to the same types of analyses that data from a monitoring program would be (e.g., there are no negative values). To view the original data from USGS please visit (http://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/factsheet.aspx?speciesid=963) and click on the real-time map (http://nas2.er.usgs.gov/viewer/omap.aspx?SpeciesID=963).

        "description": "This data set contains sensitive biological resource data for diving birds, gulls, terns, passerine birds, pelagic birds, raptors, shorebirds, wading birds, and waterfowl in South Florida (2013). Vector points in this data set represent bird nesting and wintering sites. Species specific abundance, seasonality, status, life history, and source ID information have been joined to the attribute table. Source details are stored in a separate related SOURCES data table designed to be used in conjunction with this spatial data layer. This data set comprises a portion of the ESI data for Florida. ESI data characterize the marine and coastal environments and wildlife by their sensitivity to spilled oil. The ESI data include information for three main components: shoreline habitats, sensitive biological resources, and human-use resources. See also the BIRDS data layer, part of the larger Florida ESI database, for additional bird information. Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) is more properly known as \"Sensitivity of Coastal Habitats and Wildlife to Spilled Oil\" Atlases. The term \"ESI\" is often used in reference to the whole dataset, but the term \"ESI\" is really a reference to the classification system of shoreline types known as Environmental Sensitivity Index, that classifies a shoreline on a scale from 1 to 10 based upon overall sensitivity to spilled oil. FWRI contracted out updates to Florida's ESI data for the Panhandle and South Florida in the years 2010 through early 2013. These datasets were delivered as coverages in region-polygon format that allow for overlapping polygons in the same manner as FWRI's older ESI GIS data (in Gulf-Wide Information System (GWIS) format/specification). Hundreds of new species were added and the regional products were completed and delivered as promised. However, FWRI wanted and needed a statewide product for use within the Marine Resources Geographic Information System (MRGIS) and the Florida Marine Spill Analysis System (FMSAS). This data set is a compilation of the most recent ESI mapping for each area of Florida.\r\n",

The SNBS was initiated in 1979 under a cooperative agreement between FWC (then DNR) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Its purpose is to document the total distribution, seasonality, and abundance of nesting by sea turtles in Florida. Three species of sea turtles, the loggerhead (Caretta caretta), the green turtle (Chelonia mydas), and the leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), nest regularly on Florida's beaches. Two other species, Kemp\u2019s ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) and the hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) also nest but in very small numbers. All the species are listed as either Threatened or Endangered under the Endangered Species Act. Survey data are derived from observations of tracks and other nesting sign left on the beach by sea turtles. Species identifications and determinations of nesting vs. non-nesting emergences are based on the evaluation of visible features of the track and the nest. Data are gathered on more than 200 beaches through a network of permit holders consisting of private conservation groups, volunteers, consultants, academics, local governments, federal agencies, and the Florida Park Service. Annual nest counts for the state represent a minimum estimate because not all nesting activity is recorded on surveyed beaches and not all nesting beaches in Florida are surveyed. Nest density classifications of \u201clow\u201d, \u201cmedium\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d were developed for loggerheads, green turtles and leatherbacks according to quartile ranks. For the loggerhead turtle, ranking was done within genetic subunits; ranks for green turtles and leatherbacks were on a statewide basis. Hawksbill turtles and Kemp\u2019s ridleys were denoted only as present or absent on individual beaches. Surveys in the SNBS program may vary with respect to start/stop dates, frequency, duration and beach length between years for a particular beach, as well as between beaches. This variability in the surveys, combined with the dynamic nature of sea turtle nesting activity, make the quartile ranking system for the beaches, rather than average nesting densities over a small number of years, a more appropriate measure of the level of nesting activity that takes place on a particular beach. Survey results are used by managers to evaluate and minimize impacts to turtles and their nests due to human activities such as coastal construction, beach renourishment, and recreation, as well as to identify important areas for enhanced protection or land acquisition. Direct contact by managers with the appropriate state data provider is highly recommended to obtain more detailed information about the surveys on a particular beach.\r\n",

        "description": "This shapefile is all artificial habitat mapped in the region and is a combination of the most recent SE FL benthic habitat maps. The nearshore has been updated according to Walker and Klug 2014 and combined with all previous mapping efforts. The SE FL nearshore benthic habitats were mapped using the same combined technique approach as described in Walker, Riegl, and Dodge (2008).
