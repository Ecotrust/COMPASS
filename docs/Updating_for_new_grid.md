# Updating OFR with new planning grids

## Inspect shapefile

 Check out the delivered shapefile with `ogrinfo` and/or `qgis` to make sure everything is in web mercator and generally checks out. Cross check that with the [OFR Grid Attributes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LOT9xl6_iiUSCI09_al7phZDF50HSnPPZRp768R1Xyg/edit?pli=1#gid=0) spreadsheet and identify changes marked in red.

## Edit files to reflect the new schema

* `scripts/field_map.json`: keys are the lowercase fieldname from the shapefile, values are the internal name used in python/js code.

* `mp/scenarios/models.py`: modify the `GridCell` class to make sure all attributes are reflected in the schema.

#### **If** the attribute is used for filtering:

* `mp/scenarios/models.py`: Modify the `Scenario` class with all filterable fields. There will be a boolean field named after the internal name and a series of other fields (`*_input`, `*_min`, `*_max`) depending on whether the data is categorical or a numeric slider.
* `mp/scenarios/models.py`: Modify the `serialize_attributes` method of the `Scenario` class to contain all relevant attributes. This controls the info content when clicking on existing designs.
* `mp/scenarios/forms.py`: modify the `ScenarioForm`
* `mp/scenarios/forms.py`: modify the appropriate `get_step_*_fields` and ensure the attribute shows up on the correct page in the proper order.
* `mp/scenarios/views.py`: add filtering logic for all fields to `run_filter_query`
* `media/js/scenarios.js`: add knockout observables to the `ScenarioFormModel`
* `media/js/scenarios.js`: add the internal names to the `parameters` Array

#### If the attribute is to be reported on the gridcell click info:
* `media/js/clickAttributes.js`: modify the `getGridAttributes` function for UTFGrid callbacks. Keep in mind that this uses the case-sensitive field name from the original shapefile!

#### If the attribute is to be included in summary reports for drawings:
* `mp/drawing/reports.py`: modify the `get_summary_reports` function as needed.

## Create a SQL file and load new gridcell data

Modify the `scripts/process_grid.sh` script, should be only the `SHP` and `FINAL` variables that need attention.

Run the script from your virtual machine; outputs a sql file.

    bash scripts/process_grid.sh

Load the sql file output by this script into your local dev postgis database. This will drop and completely recreate your gridcell table with the new data command like:

    psql -U postgres -d marco -f ofr_planning_grid.sql

Note that, at this point, we have manually created a postgres table for the `scenario.GridCell` model so it does not need migrations. Unfortunately the `scenario.Scenario` model does. Since we can only do migrations on an app basis (not by model) we'll need to create the migration and manually remove the migration code related to gridcells. From the VM dev server

    dj schemamigration --auto scenarios

Then open the `mp/scenarios/migrations/<migration>.py` file and delete all actions related to the `scenarios_gridcell` table from both the `forwards` and `backwards` methods.

Finally, apply the migrations locally and commit them to the repo.

    dj migrate scenarios

Finally, test and update/check the google docs spreadsheet

## Generate mbtiles:

Taken mostly from [Scott's docs](https://sites.google.com/a/pointnineseven.com/scott-s-notes/apps/our-florida-reefs-mp#mbtiles) and modified slightly.

Create a NEW OFR_Planning_Grid project in TileMill

Load shapefile

Zoom to layer extent (magnifying icon in Layers list)

Style the grid

    #ofr-planning-grid {
      ::outline {
        line-color: #888;
        line-width: 1;
        line-opacity: .5;
      }
      polygon-opacity: 0;
    }

Add interactivity attributes. Verify that the attributes show up on mouseover within TileMill (might have to hit Save)

Export MBTiles

    zooming to level 14 for now (level 16 took a couple hours, but will be what we want at some point - level 14 takes less than a minute at 7MB)
    Center:  -80.0642,26.4558,9
    Bounds:  -80.1686,25.5573,-79.9709,27.2766

Save to local drive

    OFR_Planning_Grid_20150406b.mbtiles

Move to util server, overwriting the master OFR_Planning_Grid layer. If you want to test it out, just name it something other than `OFR_Planning_Grid.mbtiles` which should be considered the "production" layer.

    scp OFR_Planning_Grid_20150406b.mbtiles util:/var/apps/mbtiles/OFR_Planning_Grid.mbtiles

Tiles json should now be available via

    http://util.point97.io/tiles/OFR_Planning_Grid.json

Update the layer via the django admin (URL and UTFURL fields)

Verify Planning Grid on the tool and via the following URLs

    http://util.point97.io/tiles/OFR_Planning_Grid/14/4548/6946.png
    http://util.point97.io/tiles/OFR_Planning_Grid/14/4548/6946.grid.json


## Fixing slivers

For an unknown reason, tiny gaps sometimes appear between polygons delivered by the client. These gaps are visibly insignificant (< 1mm on the ground) but can cause the union step in designs to think they are non-adjacent.

A quick fix is to buffer by some tiny amount. Confirm the presence of the sliver bug, identify the widest gap between cells and buffer by slightly more than 1/2 that amount:

  UPDATE "public"."scenarios_gridcell"
  SET "geometry" = ST_Multi(ST_Buffer("geometry", 0.0003));

  VACUUM ANALYZE;


## Deployment

First, note that code migrations must happen at precisely the same time as the new gridcell data is loaded. It's probably safest to shut down the app server or put it in maintenance mode while performing the deployment.

First transfer the planning grid sql file to the production server

    scp ofr_planning_grid_20150406.sql ofr:/tmp/ofr_planning_grid.sql

Then ssh into the ofr production server, pull code and run migrations

    ssh ofr
    source env/ofr/bin/activate
    cd webapps/marine_planner/mp

    git fetch
    git reset -q --hard origin/ofr

    cd mp
    python manage.py migrate


Load the gridcell data into the production database. The database name, user and password is on the ofr server in local settings.

    psql -U our_florida_reefs -d our_florida_reefs -f /tmp/ofr_planning_grid.sql

Restart the app server

    ~/webapps/marine_planner/apache2/bin/restart

and test away. It would not hurt to again refer to the google docs spreadsheet and check that all issues have been addressed.


## Provisioning notes

If you're running postgis 1.5, you won't have the `st_makevalid` function so you'll need to patch `/home/ofr/env/ofr/src/madrona/madrona/common/utils.py` with this, replacing the existing function

    def clean_geometry(geom):
        return geom

Enable sharing for all groups:

    python manage.py enable_sharing --all

Make sure admin media is available at media path:

     ln -s /home/ofr/env/ofr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/static/admin /home/ofr/webapps/marine_planner_media/admin

Migrating user data from old instances:

    # Old server
    python manage.py dumpdata \
      --exclude scenarios.gridcell \
      --exclude contenttypes \
      --exclude auth.permission \
      --indent=4 > /tmp/all_minus_gridcell.json

   # New server
   python manage.py loaddata --ignorenonexistent /tmp/all_minus_gridcell.json
   python manage.py enable_sharing --all

## Updating with new survey results

So this is basically the *first* step that kicks off the whole process - the processing and delivery of the viewpoint survey data to OFR who will subsequently deliver a processed shapefile. This doc assumes you're starting from a new shapefile delivery but this initial step is included for reference.

Updating / Exporting Survey Results

    python cronjobs/update_survey_json.py

A new file survey_results_unsummarized.json will be created/updated in the cronjobs directory
New files survey_results_4326.json and survey_results_3857.json will be added/updated in media/data_manager/geojson

The admin currently directs Survey Results layers to media/data_manager/geojson/survey_results_3857.json so running the update_survey_json script should be all you need to do (in terms of updating the visualizations).

Converting the un-summarized data (survey_results_unsummarized.json) to shapefile format for the OFR folks:

    ogr2ogr -F "ESRI Shapefile" survey_results_20150227.shp survey_results_unsummarized.json OGRGeoJSON

Note: OFR will also need the list of Normalized/laundered field names (the output produced by running the above command)
